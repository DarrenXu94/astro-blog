Hello! I'm a passionate and experienced software developer with a focus on front-end development, though I have also delved into full-stack projects. My journey in the world of programming began in 2017, and since then, I've had the opportunity to work with various cutting-edge technologies and frameworks, refining my skills along the way.

Front-end development is where my heart lies, and I have a strong proficiency in crafting dynamic and responsive user interfaces using Vue, React, and Angular. I take great pride in building seamless and visually appealing web applications that deliver exceptional user experiences.

On the backend side, I'm well-versed in .NET and NodeJS. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with technologies like Elasticsearch and MongoDB, which allow me to create efficient and performant data storage and retrieval systems.

One aspect of my work that brings me immense joy is collaborating with UX and UI designers. I thrive in environments where I can work closely with creative minds to bring their visions to life. Understanding the intricacies of design and translating them into functional, interactive experiences is a challenge I gladly embrace.

Recently, my focus has been on design systems and accessibility. I believe that creating inclusive and user-friendly applications is not just a best practice but a responsibility. By implementing design systems and ensuring accessibility, I strive to make a positive impact on the digital world, enabling all users to access and enjoy the applications I create.

In my spare time, you can often find me exploring the latest trends in web development, attending tech meetups, or contributing to open-source projects. Continuous learning is vital to me as technology never stands still, and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skill set.
