During work I use a windows machine to develop SPFX solutions on a corporate SharePoint Online tenancy. It turns out Microsoft have given developers a chance to have their [own developer tenancy](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) for personal development and playing around. I decided to have a go at setting this up to see how the process would work on my own machine.

Setting up the Microsoft developer account
------------------------------------------

After [creating an account](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) on the developer portal (I strongly recommend using your personal email as if you change jobs you will lose access) you will be able to access your [365 profile page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/profile/). On this profile page I installed the sample data pack (which says it should take a few minutes, turns out it took almost 10 hours) before installing the SharePoint data pack.

Once you've set these up you will need to create an admin account which will have a [onmicrosoft.com](mailto:something@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com) extension. This will be the account you use to log in to SharePoint with. If you have forgotten the SharePoint site name you can always visit the [admin centre](https://admin.microsoft.com/) (I had to do this).

Setting up SPFX
---------------

Following the [Set up SharePoint Environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment) guide was helpful but didn't get me all the way there. For some reason installing the Microsoft generator globally was causing issues.

    npm install @microsoft/generator-sharepoint --global
    

It was throwing a permissions error even though I had managed to install gulp and yo globally. I tried with both sudo and regular, and â€”unsafe-perm as mentioned [here](https://github.com/pnp/generator-spfx/issues/227) (different package but same problem). The [issue seemed to be a race condition](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues/992) that was resolved, but obviously not for me. For me to get around this I just create a folder called spfx and installed it locally there and ran yo @microsoft/sharepoint which worked perfectly. I guess all my SPFX webparts will exist in that folder from now on.

I ran the project with gulp serve and voila, address already in use. I ran a port scan to see what was on that address and it turns out I had postgres running on 5432.

    sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

I don't really want to stop postgres as I'll be using that for other projects so I changed the api port in serve.json in the config folder to 5439.

I ran the serve command again and got a certificate issue, but at least the webpart is running. I ran the trust cert command (gulp trust-dev-cert) as detailed on the Set up SharePoint Environment page but that didn't fix the issue. Apparently this is because the trust-dev-cert command only works for OSX and Windows.

    Automatic certificate trust is only implemented for gulp-core-build-serve on Windows and macOS

Every now and then your project will stop loading your SPFX files and you will need to visit [https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js](https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js) to re-allow the untrusted certificate.

I don't actually care about this as I won't be developing on localhost anyway but instead on the SharePoint online workbench which can be accessed by adding /\_layouts/15/workbench.aspx to the end of your site. At last the SPFX solution is running on SharePoint and we can start developing.
