			<p>Hi there,</p><p>
				My name is Darren and I am a passionate front end developer. I have
				decided to start a blog to detail down lessons I've learnt on my front
				end journey. This blog will be used to communicate problems I've
				encountered, report clever solutions and act as a reference point for
				myself and others in the future.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p><p>
				I am a Canberra local who graduated from ANU with a Bachelor's of
				Software Engineering (2016). I have dabbled with a wide range of full
				stack technologies but my personal preference is working on front end
				development such as React.
